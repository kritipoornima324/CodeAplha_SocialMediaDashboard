# CodeAplha_SocialMediaDashboard
The Social Media Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their social media activities across multiple platforms. we can access various social media accounts such as Facebook, snapchat , Instagram, and YouTube
I made this scoial media dashboard using HTML,CSS, and JS . It is a responsive website we can use this website on any devices either on laptop or on mobile devices .
I made this like a collection of all the social media accounts which a person uses in daily lifes like twitter, linkedin , snapchat, instagram , youtube etc.
It tells the engagement or followers, subscribes , posts , likes , dislikes , connections , friends following etc.
